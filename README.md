## Setup 

- Open a command prompt and execute:
    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/RaffaeleBerzoini/HRV_in_neonates.git
    ```

## Execution

- Once the project has been downloaded, head into the project working directory and execute on the Matlab command prompt: 
    ```shell
    >> main
    ```
    
- Some Dialogue Boxes will guide you during the execution. 
- After the execution, you will find two _.xls_ files (one for time domain and one for frequency domain) in the working directory with all the calculated parameters for each subject selected. 
- If statistical analysis is requested, two additional _.xls_ files are generated. These files will contain all the statistical indexes and tests computed on the parameters of the first two _.xls_ files.
